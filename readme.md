# Contact manager app

App project using ES6 classes, local storage and the HTML table JavaScript API.

You can add some test contacts to test app functionality. It is possible to save and load contacts using local storage or search them by name or e-mail. You can delete contacts by both clicking bin icon for each contact or by searching it by name or e-mail manually.

The biggest challenge for me, in this project, was implementing `search()` function and its functionality. I did it by refactoring `showContacts()` function and passing search results to it.
